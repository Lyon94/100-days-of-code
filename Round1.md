Day 9: April 13.

**Review:** It's been over a week since I started this challenge. I must say it's not been easy(but Hey! nobody said it was gonna be easy, yu know!!). At the start, I struggled with power supply and internet connection issues (I'm still battling with it.) I guess that's a battle that must be fought for all developers in Nigeria. I look forward to solving these problems soon. 

I have consistently taken at least 2 hours daily to do something related to code for the past 9 days. I recorded a low gain on one of the days as I was very tired after getting in from an outing. I read atleast 10 pages of *Atomic Habits* By James Clear daily (sadly, I think I missed one of those days --- tired day that affected code as well.) I tweeted about the things I learnt daily with regards to code (except on the tired day!) and I changed the twitter update for the 100DaysOfX challenge to 3 days per tweet. 

I surpassed the target I had for the FCC challenge. I completed the ES6, regular expression and debugging challenges of the Javascript section. I am currently going through the Data scripting challenges. It's been really challenging going through those, I'm not relenting. It's a bridge that must be crossed. Currently, I've completed over 410 challenges on FCC.

I read a few pages on Js info(I'm supposed to spend an hour going through the site daily on a less busy day.) --- Below target. I started Practical Javascript yesterday, almost midway into the course. 

*NextGoal:* I plan getting it(Practical Js) done with latest by monday. I'll be going through the zero to mastery course's highlighted sections and javascript 1 & 2 on scrimba after going through practical Js. I plan getting them done with by wednesday. By thursday, I want to start Wesbos Js course and roll on with projects. That'll most likely be the case for 30 days from then.


Day 19: May 04.
**Review:** I had to make a travel commitment for sometimes(about 8 days) and was unable to write any meaningful code during the period. I got back to the challenges on Day 13. 
I've been gaining meaning and novel insights from James Clear's book. I'm pass halfway through. I made tweet comments on twitter about the lessons and actionable points. I started a Work Out challenge that'll span through to the end of May today. 

With regards to code; I felt I've loop holes with regards to my skill set about Javascript. I made a tweet about this on Day 16 of the #100daysofcode challenge. So I decided to take 2 robust Js courses. I started with Jonas Modern Javascript course and it's been cool so far. I built a cool The Pig Game already. I made awesome progress with FCC, had to stop at the functional programming section to fill up the loop holes in my skill set.
Here is a link to all built JS Projects so far: https://lyon94.github.io/100-days-of-code/ 

I'll be going through either @AndreiNeagoie 's or @yu_angela 's course thereafter.

**The nextGoal plan above was changed. I wasn't satisfied with practical Js style and had to change direction.
***NextGoal: I want to finish up with Jonas's course, then move up to check out Angela Javascript section. I'll round it up with continuing Andrei ZTM course till the end of the Js section, afterwhich I'll be starting Wesbos project.
